Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology & Architectyre
(80 pages only)

> “Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network
access to a shared pool of confi gurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal
management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of fi ve
essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.”
-NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)

Business Drivers
* Capacity Planning: how/when a company further invests in its IT infrastructure to accomodate growing demand
* Cost Reduction: capital for infrastructure, overhead (power, continuous testing, maintenance)
* Organizational Agility: whether a company's IT infrastrcture can adapt to changes in demand, business, etc.
* Clusters: a group of independent IT resources that are interconnected and work as a single system. Inherent __[failover features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover)__

* Virtualization: "a layer of virtualization software allows physical IT resources to provide virtual images of themselves so their underlying processing capabilities can be shared by multiple users"
